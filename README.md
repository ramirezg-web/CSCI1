Topics

In this course, we will study the fundamentals of computer programming — one of the towering intellectual achievements of the 20th century. We will design, code, and debug programs using Python as we explore these concepts.

Textbook

Required:

Starting Out with Python - 5th Edition by Tony Gaddis

Optional Readings (free online resources):

How to Think Like a Computer Scientist by Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, and Chris Meyers

Python for Everybody: Exploring Data Using Python 3 by Charles Severance, University of Michigan

Course Dynamics

This course is structured as a "blended learning" format. This means is that a good portion of the lecture and reading material are presented in interactive online modules. The class is broken primarily into three components:

Online learning modules - Before each week's topics you will be expected to complete the online learning module: https://cs.nyu.edu/elearning/CSCI_UA_0002/. These modules contain video, text and interactive programming exercises. When you are finished wtih a module you will be asked to take a short online quiz (via Brightspace) to test your understanding of the concepts presented in the module.
In-class discussion and application of principles - One class period per week will focus on the design concepts and application of the principles taught in the online learning module.
In-class workshops - Weekly assignment will be presented in the other class period. The professor and two T.A.'s will be available in class to provide support and guidance as necessary.
Grading

Your grade in this course will be determined based on the items below. Note that the the following rubric serves as a guideline for how grades will be calculated. The final percentage allotted to each category is at the instruction's discretion. Attendance is highly recommended and will be taken in some form during most classes.

Assignments: 30%
Weekly Quizzes: 5%
Midterm Exam: 30%
Final Exam: 35%
If you plan to continue with computer science courses such as CSCI-UA.0101, CSCI-UA.60, CSCI-UA.61 and related coursework, you MUST get a grade of C or better in this course. No exceptions will be made.

Quizzes

There will be 11 online quizzes that go along with each online learning module. These quizzes contain a series of multiple choice questions and are worth 5% of your final grade.

Quizzes are delivered via Brightspace and can be attempted up to 5 times—your most recent score will be the one to be recorded (not your highest score). Online quizzes will be open at 5 PM, and must be completed before class on the day at 4:30 PM. Please see the course schedule for a complete list of due dates.

Unlike assignments (described below), no late submissions will be accepted for missed quizzes.

Assignments

There will be eleven assignments in this course that will be assigned on a weekly basis. In general, assignments are due weekly at 11:55 PM of the date specified (which is generally the night before the following assignment is presented). For a full outline of assignment due dates please refer to the schedule.

It is important not to get behind in turning your assignments (this class is cumulative). You cannot resubmit your assignment in Brightspace—before the deadline. Late submissions will be penalized by 10% off per day late, and assignments that are more than 7 days late can not be turned in for credit. [Please note: if you experience a hardship such as a death in the family, a hospitalization or other life issue that prevents you from coming to class or completing your work, please let me (Na'im) know so that we can together to help you through. ]

You will be using Brightspace to turn in your homework assignments. It is your responsibility to make sure that your assignments have been submitted successfully. You can do this by simply attempting to download your work after it has been uploaded to the system – if you are able to do so, your assignment was submitted successfully. If you do have trouble with Brightspace, you can always e-mail your homework to me directly; I will also provide a separate email for the grader in the event that you are asked for another submission.

All grading will be done on Brightspace as well and you can check your grades at any time by logging in there and following the "Gradebook" link. If you notice an irregularity (i.e. you mistakenly lost points for an item that you successfully completed) please let me know and I will be happy to sit down with you to review your work. All grade changes must be completed in person and cannot be done over e-mail.

Assignments that you turn in should be your own work. It is fine to talk to other students and to get assistance in how to do something, but you should not ask your fellow students to actually do the work for you. When you turn in an assignment, you are saying that you have done this work yourself. The definition of plagiarism is to present someone else’s work as though it were your own. Please read the Computer Science Department statement on academic integrity for more information.

Support

Computer Science is similar to a math course in that all the material is cumulative in nature and in that concepts build on each other. This means it's important that you not fall behind. If at any time you have questions, feel like you're falling behind, or don't understand the material there is always help available. The following resources are here to help you in the event you struggle with any concepts:

Instructor Office Hours - Instructor office hours are TBD. I am also available by appointment; by phone; by email; and by Skype. Students are encouraged to attend if they are struggling with any material.
CS Lab Tutors - the CS department has several TAs that have office hours on campus: https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring22/CSCI-UA.0002-003/common_syllabus
CAS Tutors - the University Learning Center provides free tutoring.
Software

The main software package that we will be working with this semester is the Python programming language. Python is an open-source project, and anyone can get their own copy free of charge at http://www.python.org/download. We will be using Python 3.8.7 this semester. Installation instructions are posted to the Common Syllabus at https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring22/CSCI-UA.0002-003/common_syllabus/#software

Personal Computers

Because this class involves in-class programming assignments, it's highly encouraged that you bring a laptop to class. If you don't have a laptop during in-class work, then you may work with a partner (see cooperation and acknowledgements). Keep in mind that computers often have hardware related problems and you should save your work often and back it up to a separate device. If you don't have a computer you can use the NYU computer labs (see below).

Using the NYU Computing Facilities

NYU provides numerous computer labs around campus, but the primary lab for this class are located at 18 Washington Place (this is where the class tutors will be). Further information on the labs is available from ITS.

Washington Place Lab is located at 18 Washington Place.Fourth Street Lab is located at 35 West 4th Street, 2nd Floor.
Third Avenue North Lab is located at 75 Third Avenue, Level C3 (downstairs) near 12th Street.
There are other labs as well around campus that may work as well; they are listed here. You use your ID card to gain access to the computer labs.
Note about saving your work in the labs: You will be able to save your work ITS labs under your NYU Home Account and/or on your own flash drives. Although you can write to the hard disks of the machines in the labs, you cannot be sure that you will have access to the same machine the next time you enter the lab and the drives in the lab are frequently erased. The best option is to upload your files online and download them as needed (we will go over this in class).

Feedback

This course is designed as an introductory level class and topics will be presented assuming very little prior exposure to the topics which we will study. With that said, every student learns differently and I want to ensure that each of you is getting the maximum amount out of the course content as possible. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me via e-mail or during office hours if you feel as though you are falling behind or you are not understanding a certain concept. Please also feel free to get in touch with me to discuss future courses you might wish to take in CS or any other goals that I could perhaps assist you with. I look forward to working with all of you.
