  <p class="headers2">Topics</p>
  <p>In this course, we will study the fundamentals of computer programming — one of the towering intellectual achievements of the 20th century. We will design, code, and debug programs using Python as we explore these concepts.</p>
  <p class="headers2">Textbook</p>
  <p class="notes">Required:</p>
  <p><span class="bookTitle"><a href="https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/books/9780136719199">Starting Out with Python - 5th Edition</a></span> by Tony Gaddis
    </p>
  <p class="notes">Optional Readings (free online resources):</p>
  <p><span class="bookTitle"><a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/">How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</a></span> by Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, and Chris Meyers</p>
  <p><span class="bookTitle"><a href="https://www.py4e.com/html3/01-intro">Python for Everybody: Exploring Data Using Python 3</a></span> by Charles Severance, University of Michigan</p>
  <p class="headers2">Course Dynamics</p>
  <p>This course is structured as a "blended learning" format. This means is that a good portion
  of the lecture and reading material are presented in interactive online modules. The class is broken
  primarily into three components:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span class="notes">Online learning modules</span> - Before each week's topics you will be expected
    to complete the online learning module: <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/elearning/CSCI_UA_0002/">https://cs.nyu.edu/elearning/CSCI_UA_0002/</a>. These modules contain video, text and interactive programming exercises. When you are finished wtih a module you will be asked to take a short online quiz (via Brightspace) to test your understanding of the concepts presented in the module.</li>
    <li>
      <span class="notes">In-class discussion and application of principles </span>- One class period per week will focus on the design concepts and application of the principles taught in the online learning module. </li>
    <li><span class="notes">In-class workshops </span>- Weekly assignment will be presented in the other class period. The professor and two T.A.'s will be available in class to provide support and guidance as necessary. </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="headers2">Grading</p>
  <p>Your grade in this course will be determined based on the items below. Note that the the following
  rubric serves as a guideline for how grades will be calculated. <u>The final percentage allotted to each category
  is at the instruction's discretion.</u> Attendance is highly recommended and will be taken in some form during most classes.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Assignments: 30%</li>
   <li>Weekly Quizzes: 5%</li>
   <li>Midterm Exam: 30%</li>
   <li>Final Exam: 35%</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you plan to continue with computer science courses such as CSCI-UA.0101, CSCI-UA.60, CSCI-UA.61 and related coursework, you <em><b>MUST</b></em> get a grade of C or better in this course. No exceptions will be made.</p>
  <p class="headers2">
    Quizzes</p>
  <p>There will be 11 online quizzes that go along with each online learning module.
  These quizzes contain a series of multiple choice questions and are worth 5% of your final grade.
  </p>
  <p>Quizzes are delivered via Brightspace and can be attempted up to 5 times—your most recent score will be the one to be recorded (not your highest score).
  Online quizzes will be open at 5 PM, and must be completed before class on the day at 4:30 PM. Please see the course schedule for a complete list of due dates.
  </p>
  <p>Unlike assignments (described below), <b>no late submissions will be accepted for missed quizzes</b>.</p>
  <p class="headers2">Assignments</p>
  	<p>There will be eleven assignments in this course that will be assigned
on a weekly basis. In general, <b>assignments are due weekly at 11:55 PM of
the date specified</b> (which is generally the night before the following
assignment is presented). For a full outline of assignment due dates please
refer to the schedule.</p>
  	
  	<p>It is important not to get behind in turning your assignments (this
class is cumulative).  <b>You cannot resubmit your assignment in
Brightspace—before the deadline</b>. <b>Late submissions will be
penalized by 10% off per day late, and assignments that are more than 7 days
late can not be turned in for credit</b>. [<span class="notes2">Please
note</span>: if you  experience a hardship such as a death in the family, a
hospitalization or other life issue that prevents you from coming to class or
completing your work, please let me (Na'im) know so that we can together to
help you through. ]</p>

  	<p>You will be using Brightspace to turn in your homework assignments. 
It is your responsibility to make sure that your assignments have been
submitted successfully.  You can do this by simply attempting to download
your work after it has been uploaded to the system – if you are able to
do so, your assignment was submitted successfully.  If you do have trouble
with Brightspace, you can always e-mail your homework to me directly; I will
also provide a separate email for the grader in the event that you are asked
for another submission.</p>
  
  	<p>All grading will be done on Brightspace as well and you can check your
grades at any time by logging in there and following the
"Gradebook" link. If you notice an irregularity (i.e. you
mistakenly lost points for an item that you successfully completed) please
let me know and I will be happy to sit down with you to review your work. All
grade changes must be completed in person and cannot be done over e-mail.</p>

  <p>Assignments that you turn in should be your own work. It is fine to talk to other students and to get assistance in how to do something, but you should not ask your fellow students to actually do the work for you. When you turn in an assignment, you are saying that you have done this work yourself. The definition of plagiarism is to present someone else’s work as though it were your own. Please read the<a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity"> Computer Science Department statement on academic integrity</a> for more information.</p>
  <p class="headers2">Support</p>
  </ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Computer Science is similar to a math course in that all the material is cumulative in nature and in that concepts build on each other. This means it's important that you not fall behind. If at any time you have questions, feel like you're falling behind, or don't understand the material there is always help available. The following resources are here to help you in the event you struggle with any concepts:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Instructor Office Hours - Instructor office hours are <span class="notes2"><em>TBD</em></span><em>. </em>I am also available by appointment; by phone; by email; and by Skype. Students are encouraged to attend if they are struggling with any material. </li>
    <li>CS Lab Tutors - the CS department has several TAs that have office hours on campus: <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring22/CSCI-UA.0002-003/common_syllabus/#tutoring" target="_blank">https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring22/CSCI-UA.0002-003/common_syllabus</a>

    <li>CAS Tutors - the <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/students/undergraduates/academic-services/undergraduate-advisement/academic-resource-center/tutoring-and-learning.html">University Learning Center</a> provides free tutoring.      </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="headers2">Software</p>
  <p>The main software package that we will be working with this semester is the Python programming language.  Python is an open-source project, and anyone can get their own copy free of charge at <a href="http://www.python.org/download">http://www.python.org/download</a>. We will be using <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-387/" target="_blank">Python 3.8.7</a> this semester. Installation instructions are posted to the Common Syllabus at <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring22/CSCI-UA.0002-003/common_syllabus/#software" target="_blank">https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring22/CSCI-UA.0002-003/common_syllabus/#software</a></p>
  <p class="headers2">Personal Computers</p>
  <p>Because this class involves in-class programming assignments, it's highly encouraged that you bring a laptop to class. If you don't have a laptop during in-class work, then you may work with a partner (see cooperation and acknowledgements). Keep in mind that computers often have hardware related problems and you should save your work often and back it up to a separate device. If you don't have a computer you can use the NYU computer labs (see below).</p>
  <p class="headers2">Using the NYU Computing Facilities</p>
  <p>NYU provides numerous computer labs around campus, but the primary lab for this class are located at 18 Washington Place (this is where the class tutors will be). Further information on the labs is available from ITS.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/labs/wash/">Washington Place Lab</a> is located at 18 Washington Place.Fourth Street Lab is located at 35 West 4th Street, 2nd Floor.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/labs/third/">Third Avenue North Lab</a> is located at 75 Third Avenue, Level C3 (downstairs) near 12th Street.</li>
    <li>There are <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/labs/">other labs</a> as well around campus that may work as well; they are listed <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/labs/">here</a>. You use your ID card to gain access to the computer labs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="notes2">Note about saving your work in the labs</span>: You will be able to save your work ITS labs under your NYU Home Account and/or on your own flash drives. Although you can write to the hard disks of the machines in the labs, you cannot be sure that you will have access to the same machine the next time you enter the lab and the drives in the lab are frequently erased. The best option is to upload your files online and download them as needed (we will go over this in class).</p>

  <p class="headers2">Feedback</p>
  <p>This course is designed as an introductory level class and topics will be presented assuming very little prior exposure to the topics which we will study. With that said, every student learns differently and I want to ensure that each of you is getting the maximum amount out of the course content as possible. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me via e-mail or during office hours if you feel as though you are falling behind or you are not understanding a certain concept. Please also feel free to get in touch with me to discuss future courses you might wish to take in CS or any other goals that I could perhaps assist you with. I look forward to working with all of you.</p>
