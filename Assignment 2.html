	              <p>For this assignment you will be writing 3 programs which should be saved independently as their own ".py" file. The filename you should use for each program is outlined in the sections below.  When you're finished you should submit your programs to the Assignment #2 category inside of NYU Classes.</p>

              <h3>Warm Up Exercises</h3>
              
              <div class="alert alert-warning">Note: we will be solving this problem in class as a group.  You don't need to turn in any source code for these problems.</div>
              
              <ol>
              	<li>A company has determined that its annual profit is typically 23 percent of total sales.  Write a program that asks the user to enter in the projected amount of total sales and then displays the profit that will be made from that amount.</li>
              	
              	<li>Write a program to input two integers. Call the first x and the second y. You program should calculate the quotient and remainder when x is divided by y. Here's an example: <pre>Enter number #1: 5
Enter number #2: 2
2 goes into 5 a total of 2 times with a remainder of 1</pre></li>

              	<li>A car's Miles Per Gallon (MPG) can be calculated using the following formula:
<pre>MPG = Miles driven / Gallons of Gas Used
</pre>
				Write a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons of gas used.  It should calculate the car's MPG — to the nearest integer — and display the result.</li>
				<br>
				
				<li>Write a program that asks the user to enter in 3 price values (as floating point numbers). The print out the price values so that they are formatted to two decimal places. Also make sure that the price values are right aligned and line up at the decimal point. Here's a sample running of the program:
				
				<pre>Enter price #1: 1.55
Enter price #2: 10
Enter price #3: 9532.6

Here are your prices!

Price #1: $    1.55
Price #2: $   10.00
Price #3: $ 9532.60</pre>
              
              </li></ol>
              
<h3>Problem #1: Dynamic Tip Calculator</h3>
			
<p>You and your friends are all enjoying lunch together at Kimmel. The bill comes and you need to figure out how much to tip. Your program needs to accept how much the total bill was and how much tip the user would like to leave. It should print how much the tip is and how much the total bill will be.</p>

<p>Sample input/output:</p>

<pre>Hello! I'm here to help you calculate your tip. 
How much was your bill? (enter as a number without dollar signs or commas): $56.50
How much tip would you like to leave? (enter just a number): 17
Thanks!
You need to leave $9.61 as a tip.
Your total bill will be $66.10.
</pre>

			<p>Comment your source code and describe your code to someone who may be viewing it for the first time. </p>

<p>This program should be named as follows:</p>
<p>LastNameFirstName_assign2_problem1.py (for example, "TysonNaim_assign1_problem1.py")</p>

<h3>Problem #2: Calculating Profits</h3>

<p>You work for a manufacturer, and have been asked to calculate the total profit
and profit margin made on the sales of a product.</p>

<p>Write a profit calculator that does the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask the user for the cost price per unit (in dollars).</li>
<li>Ask the user for the sales price per unit (in dollars).</li>
<li>Also, ask for the starting inventory sold.</li>
<li>Compute the total profit made—rounded to the nearest dollar.</li>
<ul>
<li>Profit = Total Sales - Total Cost</li>
</ul>
<li>Calculate the profit margin by subtracting the cost price from the sales
price and dividing by the sales price.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sample input/output:</p>

<pre>Enter cost price: 32.67
Enter sales prices: 45.00
Enter inventory sold: 1200

You made a profit of $14,796.
Your profit margin is 27.4%.
</pre>

	  <h3>Problem #2: Grade Calculator</h3>
              
              <p>Write a "grade calculation" program that does the following:</p>
              
              <ol>
<li>Ask the user for their name - store this value in a variable</li>
<li>Also ask the user for the name of a class - store this value in a variable as well</li>
<li>Ask the user for the weighting of tests in their class (i.e. tests are worth 60% of the total grade)</li>
<li>Ask the user for 3 test scores</li>
<li>Calculate the student&#8217;s test average, and print it out to the user</li>
<li>Ask the user for the weighting of homework assignments in their class (i.e. homework assignments are 40% of the total grade)</li>
<li>Ask the user for 3 homework assignment scores</li>
<li>Calculate the student&#8217;s homework average, and print it out to the user</li>
<li>Calculate the student&#8217;s final grade and display it to the user.</li>
			  </ol>
<p>Here's a sample running of the program:</p>

<pre>What is your name? Na'im
What class are you in? Intro to Programming

How much are tests worth in this class (i.e. 0.40 for 40%): 0.40
Enter test score #1: 90
Enter test score #2: 85
Enter test score #3: 97

Your test average is: 90.67

How much are homework assignments worth in this class (i.e. 0.60 for 60%): 0.60
Enter homework score #1: 100
Enter homework score #2: 90
Enter homework score #3: 80

Your homework average is: 90.0

Thanks, Na'im. Your final score in Intro to Programming is 90.27</pre>
-->

<p>Comment your source code and describe your code to someone who may be viewing it for the first time.</p>
<!-- <p>Also include your name, the date, your class section and the name of your program at the top of your file.</p>-->

<p>This program should be named as follows:</p>
<p>LastNameFirstName_assign2_problem2.py (for example, "TysonNaim_assign2_problem2.py")</p>




			<h3>Problem #3: Data Size Converter</h3>
			
			<p>Write a program that does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prompt the user to enter in file size in Kilobytes (KB)</li>
<li>Convert the supplied input into bits, bytes, megabytes and gigabytes.  You can use the following conversion values:
<ul>
<li>8 bits = 1 byte</li>
<li>1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte (KB)</li>
<li>1024 kilobytes = 1 megabyte (MB)</li>
<li>1024 megabytes = 1 gigabyte (GB)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Output your results as follows. Your converted values should line up in a column (right-justified) followed by the units of measurement (left justified).  Format your converted values to two decimal places, and add comma separators as necessary.
<pre>Enter a file size, in kilobytes (KB): 20000

20000 KB ...

... in bits                163,840,000.00 bits                
... in bytes                20,480,000.00 bytes               
... in megabytes                    19.53 MB                  
... in gigabytes                     0.02 GB</pre>
</li>
<li>Next, list out at least five ways to "crash" the program and document your errors. Include examples of at least one syntax, one logic, and one run-time error. Please include these errors as comments in the program so that the program will still run!  Here's an example:
<pre># the following line would cause a syntax error because I forgot
# to delimit the string literal I am attempting to print out
# print (Hello, World!)
</pre></li>
<li>Comment your source code and describe your code to someone who may be viewing it for the first time.  Also include your name, the date, your class section and the name of your program at the top of your file.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may assume that your user gives you a reasonable number to work with. Use the format() function to line up the results neatly.</p>
<p>This program should be named as follows:</p>
<p>LastNameFirstName_assign2_problem3.py (for example, "TysonNaim_assign2_problem3.py")</p>
