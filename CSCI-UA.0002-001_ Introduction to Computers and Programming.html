	<p>For this assignment you will be writing 3 programs which should be saved independently as their own ".py" file. The filename you should use for each program is outlined in the sections below.  When you're finished you should submit your programs to the Assignment #1 category inside of NYU Classes.</p>
	<p>You may work by yourself, with a partner or in a group of three. If you choose to work with someone else please be sure to give them credit in your source code and on NYU classes when you submit your work.</p>

<h3>Problem #1: Variables &amp; Print Statements</h3>

<p>Write a program that does the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create four variables that store the following pieces of data.  Be sure to name your variables in a way that makes sense to someone else (i.e. don't name your variables something simple that doesn't relate to the data that is being stored (like 'x' or 'y')). 
	<ul>
		<li>A class name (store the string: Introduction to Computer Programming)</li>
		<li>Test #1 average (store the number: 95)</li>
		<li>Test #2 average (store the number: 76)</li>
		<li>Test #3 average (store the number: 87)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Using the print function and your variables, generate the following output. Note the formatting in the output below - make your program match the formatting exactly.
<pre>Average Test Scores For "Introduction to Computer Programming":
- Test #1: 95
- Test #2: 76
- Test #3: 87</pre></li>
	<li>Comment your source code and describe your code to someone who may be viewing it for the first time.  Also include your name, the date, your class section and the name of your program at the top of your file.</li>
</ul>

<p>This program should be named as follows:</p>
<p>LastNameFirstName_assign1_problem1.py (for example, "TysonNaim_assign1_problem1.py")</p>

<h3>Problem #2: Printing Personal Information</h3>

<p>Prompt the user to enter: 1) their first name, 2) telephone number and 3) college major.
Write a program that displays each piece of information on a separate line â€” using a separate variable for each piece of information.</p>

<p>Sample input/output:</p>

<pre>Enter your name: Moby
Enter your phone number: 212-867-5309
Enter your college major: Philosophy
============================================

Name: Moby
Phone Number: 212-867-5309
Major: Philosophy
</pre>

<p>This program should be named as follows:</p>
<p>LastNameFirstName_assign1_problem2.py (for example, "TysonNaim_assign1_problem2.py")</p>

<h3>Problem #3: Using the print function</h3>

<p>Prompt the user to enter 3 names. Store each name in a separate variable. Then display the names back to the user in every possible order. Print the first three combinations all on one line separated by commas. Print the second three combinations with one name per line. Note the formatting in the output below - make your program match the formatting exactly.</p>

<p>Sample input/output:</p>

<pre>Please enter name #1: Allison
Please enter name #2: Jeremy
Please enter name #3: Emily

Here are your names in every possible order:
--------------------------------------------

Allison, Jeremy, Emily

Allison, Emily, Jeremy

Jeremy, Allison, Emily

Jeremy, Emily, Allison

Emily, Jeremy, Allison

Emily, Allison, Jeremy</pre>

			<p>Comment your source code and describe your code to someone who may be viewing it for the first time.  Also include your name, the date, your class section and the name of your program at the top of your file.</p>

<p>This program should be named as follows:</p>
<p>LastNameFirstName_assign1_problem3.py (for example, "TysonNaim_assign1_problem3.py")</p>
